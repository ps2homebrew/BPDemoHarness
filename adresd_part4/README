On going coding for the intro section of the BP demo.

Any of this code here is free for usage, but a thanks
greeting/beer/whatever is always nice :)

This is a triangle strip twister, with envmap.
Parameters sent via vif to it, and then object is sent via
vif, processed on vu1 and kicked to gs from there.

Base routine and inspiration came from emoon.

========================================================
This makes use of 'PbDemoLib' and is also designed as an
example for the lib.

Thanks to emoon for his work on the library :)
And to tyranid for the demo harness
========================================================

enjoy.
