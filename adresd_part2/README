On going coding for my (adresd) part2 for the BP demo.

Any of this code here is free for usage, but a thanks
greeting/beer/whatever is always nice :)

This is a spherical harmonics surface drawer, running entirely
on vu1.
Parameters sent via vif to it, and then object is generated
and kicked to gs from there.

========================================================
This makes use of 'PbDemoLib' and is also designed as an
example for the lib.

Thanks to emoon for his work on the library :)
And to tyranid for the demo harness
========================================================

enjoy.
